;; Not a formality: `sdp.core` reads/writes line ordering via a position
;; cursor over plain vectors and does integer parsing (`parse-long`) at
;; every numeric field — none of that is JVM-specific, but asserting it
;; runs identically on both hosts is cheaper than assuming it, and this
;; workspace has documented real cljs/clj divergences in adjacent code
;; (`org-modbus`'s own README: `(map int "...")` silently producing
;; zeros under ClojureScript).
